# 🛠 Implementation Plan: React Calculator Enhancement

This plan outlines three feature upgrades implemented in the React Calculator project using **Aider**.

## Feature 1: 📜 Calculation History

### 🧑‍💻 User Story  
Users should be able to see a history of previous calculations.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements  
- Introduce a state variable to store the history  
- Capture and save both expressions and results  
- Include a **Clear History** button to reset the log  

### 🗂 Files Affected  
- `App.js`  
- `calculate.js`  

### ⚠️ Anticipated Challenges  
- Managing state updates for dynamic lists  
- Ensuring the layout remains responsive across screen sizes  

## Feature 2: ⌨️ Keyboard Support

### 🧑‍💻 User Story  
Users want to interact with the calculator using their keyboard.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements  
- Add keyboard event listeners  
- Map number and operator keys (e.g., `1`, `+`)  
- Provide visual feedback for pressed keys  

### 🗂 Files Affected  
- `App.js`  

### ⚠️ Anticipated Challenges  
- Filtering invalid key presses  
- Managing focus to ensure key events are consistently captured  

## Feature 3: 🌙 Dark Mode Toggle

### 🧑‍💻 User Story  
Users prefer a dark interface for low-light environments.

### ⚙️ Technical Requirements  
- Create a theme toggle component  
- Use CSS variables to support theme switching  
- Store user preferences using `localStorage`  

### 🗂 Files Affected  
- `App.js`  
- `App.css`  
- `ToggleButton.js`  

### ⚠️ Anticipated Challenges  
- Maintaining consistent styles across components  
- Ensuring state persistence on page reload  

This implementation plan served as the roadmap for guiding Aider-assisted development. Each feature was scoped with potential issues in mind, making the enhancement process smoother and more structured.
